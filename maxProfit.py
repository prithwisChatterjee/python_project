# Problem:Stock Buy and Sell â€“ Max one Transaction Allowed
# Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is
# to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one 
# transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell.
# This Algo provides the earliest buy day and earliest Sell day.If same profit can be made later and on minimum
# days this algo does not check that condition.
